[dreamer GitLab](https://gitlab.com/luxtorpeda/luxtorpeda).

## Pre-requisites

Compatibility tool will work on any modern 64-bit Linux distribution.
All packaged games are compiled for Steam Runtime environment and require no
additional dependencies.

**Using Luxtorpeda with [Steam native runtime](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam/Troubleshooting#Steam_native_runtime) may or may not work, but is not supported.**

## Installation (using tarball)

*This is pre-release quality software, expect bugs and missing features.*

*The packages.json for the supported packages and getting the latest versions will get updated on each launch of luxtorpeda, without any input needed from the user. New releases of the luxtorpeda client will need to be downloaded manually, but a new release of the client is not required when a package is created or updated, unless that package depends on a new feature (which will be noted in the release notes).*

1. Close Steam.
2. Download latest version at https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda/releases
3. Move and unpack tarball to compatibilitytools.d directory (create one if it does not exist):

        $ cd ~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/ || cd ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/
        $ tar xJf luxtorpeda-26.tar.xz

4. Start Steam.
5. In game properties window select "Force the use of a specific Steam Play
   compatibility tool" and select "Luxtorpeda".

## Installation (debug build, from source)

0. Download the latest version of Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/ and verify that openssl is installed on your system.

Debian, Ubuntu et consortes

       $ sudo apt install libssl-dev
       
Fedora 

       $ sudo dnf install openssl-devel
       
1. Close Steam.
2. Clone the repository, then use makefile to trigger `cargo build` and install:

       $ git clone https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda.git
       $ cd luxtorpeda
       $ make user-install

3. Start Steam.
4. In game properties window select "Force the use of a specific Steam Play
   compatibility tool" and select "Luxtorpeda&nbsp;(dev)".


## Known issues

- No known issues at this time.

## Configuration

A configuration json file named `config.json` will be located in the luxtorpeda directory. It has the following paramters:

- host_url - This is used to determine where the packages.json file is located remotely, for use in automatic updates of this file.
- should_do_update - If this parameter is set to true, then the packages.json file will be updated automatically.
- active_dialog_command - default (pick the best for the running desktop), zenity, or kdialog. If this parameter does not exist, luxtorpeda assumes zenity.

## Supported titles

Just click "Play" and Luxtorpeda will download and install the package for you.
You need to select Luxtorpeda as a compatibility tool first, of course.

When you launch a game that supports multiple engines, a Zenity-based prompt will appear asking for the engine that should be downloaded and launched. Once the engine has been picked, a second prompt will ask if the engine should become the default. Launches after this if "Yes" is picked in this dialog will not ask for the engine again. A file can be deleted to restore the engine prompt for a particular game. The file will have the following format: `~/.config/luxtorpeda/<app_id>/default_engine_choice.txt`

Want a specific game? 

Check [issues](https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/issues) to see if we are working on it.

You can also make a package request by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/issues/new/choose)

You can also [create a package yourself](https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/blob/master/docs/Creating_a_Package.md)

## Development

You can use `cargo` as with any Rust project; `make` serves only as a convenient
frontend for packaging and triggering longer `cargo` commands.
